# ROSIE
Welcome to the Reptilian Offspring Sex and Incubation Environment (ROSIE) Database, a compilation of offspring sex ratio measurements and the associated incubation conditions during embryonic development, focusing on reptile species.

The first version of this database focuses solely on the Order Testudines (turtles and tortoises), though future updates will expand this database to include all reptilian orders. Updates to expand the taxonomic coverage and maintain the up-to-date nature of this database will occur annually.

Users are encouraged to contact C. Krueger to submit additional data or correct identified errors in the database.
