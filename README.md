# ROSIE
Welcome to the Reptilian Offspring Sex and Incubation Environment (ROSIE) Database, a compilation of offspring sex ratio measurements and the associated incubation conditions during embryonic development, focusing on non-avian reptile species.

The first version of this database focuses solely on the order Testudines, though future updates will expand this database to include all non-avian reptile orders. Updates to expand the taxonomic coverage and maintain the up-to-date nature of this database will occur biannually.

Users are encouraged to contact C. Krueger to submit additional data or correct identified errors in the database.
